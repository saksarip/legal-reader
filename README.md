#Legal Reader
A Chrome extension to help quickly read the complex legal agreements you would normally scroll past. Built with javascript. Toggle the slide to turn the summarizations on and off.

Improvements to be made: Improving how original page is reset (currently just refreshing the entire page, losing any information a user has inputted into the page) Improving text summarization to a real ML model (perhaps with TensorFlow)
